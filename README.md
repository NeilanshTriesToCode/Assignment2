# Psychiatrist Chatbot as a Client-Server Service

- The app employs sockets to enable communication between Client (user) and the Server (Bot).
- The interface acting between the Client (user) and the Server (bot) is HTML.
- Algorithms for bot's responses are similar to those used for the Discord bot.
- Client side is frontend, while the server side is backend.
